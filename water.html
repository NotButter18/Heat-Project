        Water also plays a huge role in the environment being home to almost 242,000 different species of animals. It also has a huge population of plant species as all plants and animals need water to survive. Fish is also one of the most eaten foods around the world by animals and humans. Without marine life the marine food chain would come crashing down as fish is the base for everything else. Temperature also can influence this as most fish need a specific temperature to survive. Fish either live in warm salt waters or colder fresh waters.      </p>
