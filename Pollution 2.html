        As we already know, greenhouse gasses trap heat inside the atmosphere. But it can also block heat from entering the atmosphere too. This is important because after the heat trapped in the atmosphere dissipates more won't be able to come in and because of the abundance of heat the earth will slowly cooldown until it looks like a snowball(aka snowball earth). This is also called an ice age. This will affect everything from the mostly evaporated oceans to deserts and jungles as with harsh cold temperatures many animal and plant species will perish. This is very dangerous as a lot of the things we eat are a part of this group. This will also cause an abundance of food. because of this many people will start to die due to starvation...
