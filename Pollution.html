        Pollution can affect the environment. This is known as climate change. Climate change is when gasses in the atmosphere trap heat inside. At the moment Climate change is not a big problem but it can get very bad if we don’t start to do something about it. If the gasses in the atmosphere trap enough heat our planet will basically become a giant oven with the heat inside but it will only stay for a short amount of time. The events following the initial heat period are what we should really be worried about…
